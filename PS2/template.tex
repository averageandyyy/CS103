Problems One through Six are to be answered by editing the appropriate files (see the Problem Set \#2 instructions). You won't include your answers to those problems here.

\section*{Symbols Reference}
Here are some symbols that may be useful for this PSet. If you are using \LaTeX, view this section in the template file (the code in \texttt{cs103-ps2-template.tex}, not the PDF) and copy-paste math code snippets from the list below into your responses, as needed. If you are typing your Pset in another program such as Microsoft Word, you should be able to copy some of the symbols below from this PDF and paste them into your program. Unfortunately the symbols with a slash through them (for ``not'') and font formats such as exponents don't usually copy well from PDF, but you may be able to type them in your editor using its built-in tools.
\begin{itemize}
    \item Logical AND: $\land$
    \item Logical OR: $\lor$
    \item Logical NOT: $\lnot$
    \item Logical implies: $\to$
    \item Logical biconditional: $\leftrightarrow$
    \item Logical TRUE: $\top$
    \item Logical FALSE: $\bot$
    \item Universal quantifier: $\forall$
    \item Existential quantifier: $\exists$
\end{itemize}

\LaTeX typing tips:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Set (curly braces need an escape character backslash): ${1, 2, 3}$ (incorrect), $\{1, 2, 3\}$ (correct)
    \item Exponents (use curly braces if exponent is more than 1 character): $x^2$, $2^{3x}$
    \item Subscripts (use curly braces if subscript is more than 1 character): $x_0$, $x_{10}$
\end{itemize}

\section*{Problem Seven: Yablo's Paradox}
    i.
    \begin{shaded}
        \begin{itemize}
            \item 
                Theorem: There does not exist a natural number $n$ where the statement $S_{n}$ is true.
            \item 
                Proof: We wish to show that there does not a natural number $n$ where the statement $S_{n}$ is true. Assume, for the sake of contradiction, that there exists a natural number $n$ where the statement $S_{n}$ is true. 
            \item
                Since $S_{n}$ is true, we know that for any natural number $m$, such that $m>n$, the statement $S_{m}$ is false. This allows us to conclude that the statement $S_{n+1}$ is false. Since statement $S_{n+1}$ is false, we know that there exists some natural number $l$, such that $l>n+1$, where the statement $S_{l}$ is true.
            \item 
                However, this is impossible due to our prior assumption and the fact that $l>n$, which implies that the statement $S_{l}$ must be false. We have arrived at a contradiction and so our assumption must have been wrong. Therefore, there does not exist a natural number $n$ where the statement $S_{n}$ is true. $\blacksquare$
        \end{itemize}
    \end{shaded}
    
    ii.
    \begin{shaded}
        \begin{itemize}
            \item 
                Theorem: There does not exist a natural number $n$ where the statement $S_{n}$ is false.
            \item 
                Proof: We want to show that there does not exist a natural number $n$ where the statement $S_{n}$ is false. Assume for the sake of contradiction that there exists a natural number $n$ such that the statement $S_{n}$ is false.
            \item 
                Since the statement $S_{n}$ is false, we know that there must exist a natural number $m$, such that $m>n$, where the statement $S_{m}$ is true. Since $S_{m}$ is true, we know that for any natural number $l$, such that $l>m$, the statement $S_{l}$ is false. Similar the the previous question, since $S_{l}$ is false, there must exist a natural number $o$, such that $o>l$, where the statement $S_{o}$ is true. However, this is impossible due to the earlier fact that since $o>m$, the statement $S_{o}$ must be false. We have arrived at a contradiction, which means our inital assumption must have been wrong. Therefore, there does not exist a natural number $n$ where the statement $S_{n}$ is false. $\blacksquare$
        \end{itemize}
    \end{shaded}
    
    iii.
    \begin{shaded}
        \begin{itemize}
                        \item 
                            Since there are no statements after $T_{9,999,999,999}$, this statement is vacuosly true.
                        \item 
                            Any statement $T_{n}$, where $0<=n<9,999,999,999$, is false, since if they were true, it must mean that $T_{9,999,999,999}$ is false, which is impossible since as mentioned earlier, it is vacuosly true.
        \end{itemize}
    \end{shaded}

\section*{Problem Eight: Hereditary Sets}
    i.
    \begin{shaded}
        \begin{itemize}
            \item 
                Theorem: There exists a hereditary set.
            \item 
                Proof: We wish to show that there exists a hereditary set. Let $S=\emptyset$. For $S$ to be a hereditary set, we need to show that every element in $S$ is also a hereditary set.
            \item 
                Since $S$ is the empty set and has no elements, the proposition that every element in $S$ is an hereditary set is vacuosly true. Therefore, $S$ itself is a hereditary set. $\blacksquare$
        \end{itemize}
    \end{shaded}
        
    ii.
    \begin{shaded}
        \begin{itemize}
            \item 
                Theorem: If $S$ is a hereditary set, then $\powerset{S}$ is also a hereditary set.
            \item 
                Proof: Pick an arbitrary set $S$ such that $S$ is a hereditary set. We want to show that $\powerset{S}$ is also a hereditary set. To do so, we need to show that any $y\in \powerset{S}$ is a hereditary set.
            \item 
                Pick an arbitrary $y\in \powerset{S}$. Since $y\in \powerset{S}$, $y$ must be a subset of $S$. Pick an arbitrary $x\in y$. Since $x\in y$, $x \in S$, which means that $x$ must also be a hereditary set. Since for all $x\in y$ is a hereditary set, y must also be a hereditary set. Therefore, any arbitrary $y\in \powerset{S}$ must also be a hereditary set, which is what we wanted to show. $\blacksquare$
        \end{itemize}
    \end{shaded}

\section*{Problem Nine: Tournament Champions}
    i.
    \begin{shaded}
        \begin{itemize}
            \item 
                D is not a champion. E is a champion. $\blacksmiley$
        \end{itemize}
    \end{shaded}
    
    ii.
    \begin{shaded}
        \begin{itemize}
            \item 
                Theorem: If player $c$ won more games than anyone else in $T$ or is tied for winning the greatest number of games, then $c$ is a tournament champion.
            \item
                Proof: Assume for the sake of contradiction that there exists a tournament $T$ such that there exists a player $c$ where c either won the most games in $T$ or is tied for winning the most games and $c$ is not a champion.
            \item 
                Let the number of games that $c$ won be an arbitrary natural number $x$. 
                Since $c$ is not a tournament champion, there must exist a player $p$ such that $p$ won against $c$ and for every other player $q$, if $c$ won against $q$ then $p$ won against $q$. This implies that player $p$ has $x+1$ wins.
            \item
                This is impossible, due to earlier assumption that $c$ must have either the most wins or is tied for the most wins. We have arrived at a contradiction and hence, our assumption must have been wrong. Therefore, if player $c$ won more games or is tied for winning the most number of games, then $c$ is a tournament champion. $\blacksquare$
        \end{itemize}
    \end{shaded}

\section*{Optional Fun Problem: Insufficient Connectives}

\begin{shaded}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item 
            Theorem: We cannot express every possible propositional logic formula using just $\leftrightarrow$ and $\bot$.
    \end{itemize}
